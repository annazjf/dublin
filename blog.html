        <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p>Dublin is a pretty walkable city to explore and is very suitable for coffee lovers. It has rich cultural history related to the rebellion against British government in the history. I learned from the bus tour that the Irish people experienced extreme poverty and famine due to the negligence of the British governance. People were suffering from the poor living condition and diseases. During the rebellion, women play an important part in the war and many bullet holes are still shows on the historical building walls. As I just arrived this morning, I was really tired for the whole day but still tried my best to stay awake :D </p>

        <h3>Whisky Museum Visit & Mall Exploration</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-08">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p>Today I had my first HTML and CSS course in the morning. In the afternoon after a brief lunch, I headed to the Javir shopping center to get my esim card for Ireland and took a lot of pictures on my way there about the street and architectures. I bought some postcards and a discounted green Claddagh ring on my way to the Whisky Museum. Inside the museum, I learned a lot about how the whisky is been made and its history. During the old age, Irish people got introduced to alcohol by the perfume bring by the monks from the middle east. They later developed whisky to cure people from diseases and to drink during a party. The top of the whisky in the barrel is methane which is poisonous.  There are a lot of illegal alcohol trade going on in Ireland compared in England and Scotland, and they got along with it by stating that they don't understand English. Because making alcohol is illegal at that time, people bury the barrel in the forest and sometimes forgot where they buried them :0 Although Ireland has a lot of potatoes, they use barley to make whisky. The flavor of whisky is from the combination of alcohol and the motion of shrinking and expanding of the wooden barrel. The sugar and flavor from the wood would then transport to the whisky through the temperature changes. If they mix the malt (processed the barley with hot water) with the bare barley, it will generate an oilier taste. Some brand of whisky is been purchased by French people when Irish whisky got unpopular. </p>
