        <h2>About Glendalough</h2>
        <p>Glendalough is such an amazing place to spend a day with nature.  We spend some time at the monastic site to see the round tower and the St Kevin’s Church. It’s impressive to witness stone houses in such an ancient town could still last till today without the help of cement but purely be built up with stone. There are even some sheep behind the round tower, and I can tell that they just shaved :> </p>
        <p>After visiting the historical site, I walked towards the river which is a fascinating trail around the mountain. The tree and grass are extremely green. With the creek path curving through the forest, it feels like emerged in a fairy tale. The lake is very clear which makes me tempted to walk into the water!
        </p>
        <p>In a stunning glaciated valley in County Wicklow, in the sixth century, one of Ireland's most revered saints founded a monastery. The foundation of St Kevin at Glendalough became one of the most famous religious centres in Europe.</p>
        <p>The remains of this 'Monastic City', which are dotted across the glen, include a superb round tower, numerous medieval stone churches and some decorated crosses. Of particular note is St Kevin's Bed, a small man-made cave in the cliff face above the Upper Lake. It is said that St Kevin lived and prayed there, but it may actually be a prehistoric burial place that far predates him.</p>
