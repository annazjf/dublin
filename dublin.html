        <h2>About Dublin</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Dublin, a city that's as intimate as a village and as friendly as an Irish pub. Framed by mountains, centred on a river and edged by a beautiful bay, the city's streets and alleys are filled with vibrant art and historic buildings, hip cafés and traditional "old man" pubs, as Dubliners call them. Walk the streets and you'll feel the energy of over 1,000 years of history, as echoes of the Vikings mix with buzzing boutiques, cobbled streets reverberate with the sounds of buskers, and 18th century parks play host to festivals, film and food markets.</p>

        <h3>Ha'penny Bridge</h3>
        <p>The Ha'Penny Bridge is Dublin's oldest pedestrian crossing over the river Liffey. It was erected in 1816 as the Wellington Bridge and it acquired its better known nickname from the halfpenny toll levied on all users of the bridge up to 1919.</p>
        <p>The Ha'Penny Bridge is one of the earliest cast-iron structures of its kind. In 2012, citing a maintenance and damage risk, Dublin City Council removed a number of love locks from the Ha'penny Bridge and nearby Millennium Bridge.</p>

        <h3>Doors of Dublin</h3>
        <p>The eighteenth and nineteenth century doors of Dublin, perhaps the most iconic images of the city's architectural Golden Age. Many theories have been put forward to explain why they are so brightly painted and ornamented, none unfortunately likely to be true. It has been suggested, for instance, that the practice originated at the time of Elizabeth 1, when a Puritan administrator decreed that all the city's door and window frames should be the same drab brown colour. In an act of the defiance, the artistic and expressive population responded by painting them in the brightest hues they could find. A similar story dates from reign of Queen Victoria in the late 1800's. Some claim that after the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert, the grieving monarch ordered all the doors in Dublin painted black in his memory. Once again the rebellious Dubliners refused and turned their front doors into a riot of colour.</p>

        <h3>Molly Malone Statue</h3>
        <p>Molly Malone is a visual representation of the popular song of the same name which tells of a beautiful fishmonger who walked the streets selling her trade. She is typically represented as a trader by day and prostitute by night.</p>
        <p>Set in Dublin, the song has become the unofficial anthem of the city. While there is no solid evidence to suggest the song is based on a real woman, the Dublin Millennium Commission did endorse claims of a connection to a Molly Malone who died on 13 June 1699, and subsequently declared June 13th “Molly Malone Day.”</p>
        <p>Officially unveiled in 1988, the, um, well-endowed depiction of the woman has become locally known by many a nickname: The Tart with the Cart, The Dish with the Fish, The Dolly with the Trolley, The Trollop with the Scallop and The Flirt in the Skirt.</p>
        <p>Location: Corner of Grafton/Suffolk Streets.</p>
