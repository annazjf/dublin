        <h2>About Belfast</h2>
        <p>Belfast is the capital city and principal port of Northern Ireland, standing on the banks of the River Lagan and connected to the open sea through Belfast Lough and the North Channel. It is second to Dublin as the largest city on the island of Ireland with a population in 2021 of 345,418 and a metro area population of 671,559.</p>

        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p>Belfast is the capital in North Ireland affiliated with the United Kingdom. Unlike southern Ireland belongs to the EU, North Ireland involved in a lot of conflict with the south regarding the relationship between Ireland and the UK. I heard from people who joined the black taxi tour that there is even a wall divide the two parts of Ireland similar to the Berlin Wall. I joined a one-day bus tour from Dublin to cross the border to North Ireland. I am glad that we don't need to do any passport check because technically I need a UK visa to go to Belfast and I did not bring it along with me :0. I'm not sure why I was so sleepy that I was barely awake when our guide announced that we crossed the border.</p>
        <h3>Titanic Museum</h3>
        <p>Our first stop is the Titanic Museum. It's a relative new museum with only a few years old but with very impressive building design looks like the titanic from the outside and interactive experience inside the building. The first few sections illustrate the mass production of linen and the history of ship building. There is even a ride inside the museum like a mini roller-coaster for both young and old people to get to know the ship building. Such a huge project with so many labors and effort just disappeared with millions of lives in one day. It's so depressing to think about how much grave people suffered when that happens. What I like most about the museum is the telegraph in the exhibition allows me to try typing the word “code” to imitate emergency communication on the ship. I love to learn about the history of shipbuilding, but we end up spending too much time in the first few sections that we rushed through the actual Titanic section. The ending sessions is very moving, and I hope to come back to this museum by myself again to immerse myself in the story of Titanic more in details.</p>

        <h3>Duluce Castle</h3>
        <p>Our next stop is the Dunluce castle next to the seashore in the very north of Ireland. Dunluce is one of the most picturesque and romantic of Irish Castles. With evidence of settlement from the first millennium, the present castle ruins date mainly from the 16th and 17th centuries. It's impressive to see the rinse from that ancient time still preserved well after hundreds of years of erosion from the sea wind and rains.

        <h3>The Giant Causeway</h3>
        <p>The scenery on our final stop is the Giant Causeway is absolutely fascinating. With green grass and black faced sheep on the side of the road, I feel very relaxed and calmed by the charm of rural Ireland. At the time I arrived the Giant Causeway, I recalled the film Harry Potter definitely have a scene been filmed here. It's still rainy when we are there, so the hexagon shaped stone is very slippery with water on everywhere. But this does not affect the spectacular of this natural phenomenon. The rocks near the sea are black and the one that are near the land are gray, which add up to the mysteriousness.  I ate a shrimp sandwich and vegetable soup at a restaurant by the Giant Causeway called “the Nook”. It was a school before, and people changed it to a restaurant due to the small building size. It's interesting to see that the restaurant needs to pay and order first. </p>
        <p>The weather is not great for the duration of our tour. It has been raining all day long until we start our way back to Dublin, but I enjoyed it so much and wish to do a game of thrown theme tour in the future.
