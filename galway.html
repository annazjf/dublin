            <p>In Galway, I explored the Galway market which has a lot of handmade art gadget and street food. It's very enjoyable to just walk around and see those stands. Most vendors are here for both Saturday and Sunday and a lot of the products are produced locally. I wish I tried the oyster at the seafood stand. </p>

            <p>We went to the communication museum which impressed me greatly. It is a small museum but full of old digital devices from telephones to old apple computer models for people to interact. I enjoyed taking this hands-on opportunity to play around the ancient models. I didn't know that the old apple models were so creative with different shape and graphic design. I wish to ring the old wheel-typing style telephone like inside a movie for a long time, and I finally got a chance to do so! It's impressive to learn about how the early stage of communication development and the science behind it. Our guide showed us how the telegraph utilizing electromagnetic field sending messages through air or sparkle flashing light by changing the electrical connection and told us the story of the long distance connection with one vulnerable wire connecting the US and Ireland from the sea. </p>

            <p>The pub is also a big thing in Galway. Compared to the bar in Dublin, it's livelier in Galway town where people all come out to the street to enjoy the night life. As the town is smaller, it's more walkable and relaxing to explore the streets. I witnessed some drunk people almost start a fight but stopped by their friend in the afternoon. I don't think this is a common scene in other countries. For dinner, our group got fish and chips from the Mc. Donagh's. The fish is very fresh but a bit too greasy for me. In the evening, I went to a traditional Irish pub where some people gathered around playing traditional Irish music. This live house experience is very unforgettable to me as I immersed myself in the enthusiastic Irish culture; people clap their hands with the beats and sometimes dance with it. I can tell that the building is also very old from the pilling painted walls. This traditional pub only has beers and does not serve any cocktails. I was surprised to hear that some local people think Guinness bear is too strong and not their favorite. </p>
